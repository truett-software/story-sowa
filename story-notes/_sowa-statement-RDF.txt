Humans are taught to use text and numbers to communicate knowledge in human-readable form.

Machines also need to be taught to share and apply knowledge â€“ knowledge encoded in a machine-readable form.

To make that possible we need:

Open Standards for digital sentence representation - e.g., the RDF Language

Open Standards for symbols that function like names - e.g., HTTP hyperlinks

Open Standards for representing relationship types - e.g., RDF Schema and OWL to describe entity-relationship types in machine-comprehensible form.

Database Management Systems to manage data represented as sentence-graphs, using the open standards above.

John F Sowa teaches us how to build sentence-graphs.
