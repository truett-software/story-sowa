Graphs
	

Existential Graph
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph#/media/File:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg
	An existential graph is a type of diagrammatic or visual notation for logical expressions, proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce, who wrote on graphical logic as early as 1882, and continued to develop the method until his death in 1914. 

Conceptual Graph
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_graph
	A conceptual graph is a formalism for knowledge representation. John F. Sowa used them to represent the conceptual schemas used in database systems.
