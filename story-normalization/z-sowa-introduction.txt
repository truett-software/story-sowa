A mental model is an explanation of how something works in the real world.

It represents a view of the world and relationships among its various parts.

An information model implements a mental model by defining data structures (things) and their interrelationships.

Logic describes how parts of the model are linked together to make a working information system.

A graph is one way to organize an information model.

In this presentation, John F Sowa shows how to create a graph using natural language and symbols.
